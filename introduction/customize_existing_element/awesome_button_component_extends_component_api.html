                It is a proposed extension that appears in the Custom Elements specification

                It allows you to say that an existing, standard element is really a custom element
                which allows for backwards compatibility. If custom elements are not supported by the browser (the spec is still a draft and has very limited browser support) then it will fall back to the default behaviour.

        /*
            Notes:

                We have to define a constructor which always does a super() call first as well.

                We hook into the click event by adding a new event listener (note we have to bind it on  'this' ) and display an alert box.

                We need to tell the Custom Elements Registry which native HTML element is being extended by adding a third parameter to the define() method. Again, this is a required argument, defined by the Custom Elements Spec, to notify the HTML parser which interface needs to be extended.
